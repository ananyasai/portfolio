## Introduction
According to Intel, “over 4.7 billion Bluetooth® devices were shipped in 2021. As one of the most common wireless connectivity standards in the world, Bluetooth technology plays an integral part in everyday life.”

Bluetooth technology has revolutionized communication since its development in the 1990’s by Dutch engineer, Dr. Jaap Haarsten. It allows devices to communicate with each other without supporting network infrastructure such as a wireless router or access point. 

Today, individuals predominantly employ Bluetooth technology to establish connections between various devices, including wireless headphones, keyboards, mice, and speakers, with both personal computers and mobile devices. This communication is facilitated through short-range radio frequency connections, allowing various devices equipped with Bluetooth to interact within a specified distance.
