  abstract = {This paper investigates the performance implications of deploying Quantum-Safe Cryptography (QSC) on websites. Through controlled experiments with varying file sizes and network conditions, a framework was developed to measure website response under post-quantum encryption schemes. The findings aim to accelerate adoption by providing empirical evidence and practical tools for web developers and cybersecurity professionals.}
